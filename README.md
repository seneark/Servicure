## About

Servicure provides an easy to use method for the victims to contact an emergency service and then track how far this help is from them. As soon as the victim sends a distress call, it is redirected to the currently functioning emergency call centre of India.
The Features of our App are as follows:

- Victim Sends out a distress call.
- Then the operators will assign the closest and accessible emergency centre to the victim according to the requirement of the call.
- After assigning the authority working there would assign the available and ready personnel to the crime/ emergency site and activate the distress call.
- After that both victim and emergency personnel can track each other location through a map show on their screens.
